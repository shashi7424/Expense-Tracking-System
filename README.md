# expense_tracker_system
Daily Expense Tracker System is designed to keep a track of Income-Expense of a Housewife on a day-to-day basis. This System divides the Income based on daily expenses. If you exceed day’s expense, system will cut it from your income and will provide new daily expense allowed amount. If that day’s expense is less, system will add it in savings. Daily expense tracking System will generate report at the end of month to show Income-Expense Curve. It will let you add the savings amount, which you had saved for some particular Festivals or days like Birthday or Anniversary.
